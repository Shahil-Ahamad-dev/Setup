# Setting Up Node.js and Express.js in VS Code

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a Node.js and Express.js environment in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).

---

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---

## Step 1: Initialize a New Node.js Project
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:
   ```bash
   mkdir my-express-app
   cd my-express-app
   ```
3. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```
   This will create a `package.json` file with default settings.

---

## Step 2: Install Express.js
1. Install Express.js as a dependency:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```
2. Verify the installation by checking the `package.json` file. The `dependencies` section should include `express`.

---

## Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code
1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
2. Open the `my-express-app` directory:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

---

## Step 4: Create an Express.js Server
1. In the VSCode Explorer, create a new file named `server.js`.
2. Add the following code to `server.js`:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();

   const PORT = 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, Express!');
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
   });
   ```

---

## Step 5: Run the Server
1. Open the integrated terminal in VSCode (`Ctrl + ~` or `Cmd + ~` on macOS).
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see "Hello, Express!" displayed.

---

## Step 6: Install Useful VSCode Extensions (Optional)
To enhance your development experience, consider installing the following VSCode extensions:
- **Node.js Extension Pack**: Helps with Node.js development.
- **ESLint**: For JavaScript linting.
- **Prettier**: For code formatting.
- **REST Client**: Test your API endpoints directly in VSCode.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If `node` is not recognized, ensure Node.js is added to your system's PATH.
- Use `npm install` to re-install dependencies if you encounter errors with missing packages.
